                            I am a 21 year old computer science student at De Anza College. 
                            I am pursing an associates degree in computer science and another in mathematics and 
                            I am expected to finish in June of 2022. My goal is to transfer to a university and achieve a bachalors of sciences
                            degree in computer science. When I am not learning or coding I enjoy exploring the nature,trading in the stock market, spending time with friends,
                            and taking on building projects at home.

                            As a student, most of my traditional programming knowledge is in Java and a little bit is in Python.
                            I have taught my self scripting and automation in Python to use in several personal projects along
                            with learning to use APIs to incorperate into these projects. 
                            I am currently going through the process of teaching my self Golang in hopes to be able to understand and take advantage of its many built-in frameworks.

                    I have given a brief description of some of my favorite projects below.
                    Feel free to take a look at my projects indepth on my Github page.

                        <p>
                            Having joined the stock market in early 2020. I had a serious issue with
                            constantly not being able to keep track of certain stock tickers and their moves.
                            Thus I created a script that will interact with the TD Ameritrade API to grab the prices of some stock tickers
                            and based of my own set parameters of the ticker's support and resistance levels the script will nteract with the Discord API
                            to send my self a message to notify when the price levels have reached a certain price to either buy or sell.
                        </p>
                        <div class = "text"> Password Generator</div>
                        <p>
                            Having learned a small amount of cryptography from a previous discrete math class, and hashing from a data structures advantage
                            and algorithms class, I created a password generator that generates a password based on the given parameters
                            and stores the password and will not let the user retrieve the password unless the correct key is provided.
                        </p>
